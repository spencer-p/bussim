# bussim

This project is a client to my library
[traffic](https://github.com/spencer-p/traffic). It simulates car traffic
relative to some form of public transportation. In the code, this public
transportation method is referred to as busses (hence the name), but the paper
that was written with this program talks about trains.

This repository is interesting because it contains details about how cars and
~~busses~~ trains operate and how agents' personal opinions effect their
choices. The interesting work is in `caredge.go` and `busedge.go`.

If you'd like to know more about this project, most of the complicated code  and
documentation is in the [traffic](https://github.com/spencer-p/traffic) library.
